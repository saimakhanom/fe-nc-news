# NC News
This project is the client side app for the the NC News API I created, for which the live API can be accessed [here](https://be-nc-news-noc1.onrender.com/api), and the repo [here](https://github.com/saimakhanom/sk-be-nc-news).

This project has been bootstrapped with Vite and React. It allows users to log in, view and update articles, post comments, as well as upvote/downvote articles and comments. The live version of the website can be found [here](https://feature-all-articles--elaborate-gingersnap-7fd3ab.netlify.app/).
